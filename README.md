# Bristol CS Letter class

Designed to some extent according to the [university brand guidelines](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing/SitePages/Brand-guidlines.aspx).

- Based on the KOMA-script `scrlttr2` class for letters.
- Requires XeLaTeX to compile (due to unusual fonts).
- Simple `latexmkrc` file included to help `latexmk` go.

This is a template, so try the "Use this template" button to make a new repo.

Also it uses a submodule for fonts, so clone with
> git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:your-username/your-letter-repo.git
